in file2.c main get inputs for alpha beta again then do bitwise operation 
alpha>>2 
beta<<3

in file2.c destructor get inputs alpha beta again then do shorthand operation,alpha*=4;beta%=3;



6. Ask the informations from user like name(char array), service(char), status(char array), org(char array), package(int)
