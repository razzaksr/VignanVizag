1.The function drawPrintPattern(int n) is expected to print the first n line of the pattern
shown below. (n >=0) & (n should be an odd number)
Sample input 1:
Enter the value of n: 5
Sample output 1:
**1**
*111*
11111
Sample input 2:
Enter the value of n: 3
Sample output 2:
*1*
111
2. The Function arrayReverse(int *arr,int len) accepts an array arr and length len(len >=0) as an argument.The function is expected to reverse the elements of the input array.
For example, if the input array arr is {20,30,10,40,50} the function is expected to return{50,40,10,30,20}
3. You must implement the function printPrime(int num,int digit) to accept the initial
number num and number of digits n as inputs and prints all the prime numbers of n digits
starting from the initial number num Use the PrimeBank structure and the associate
function for this task.
Sample input:
Enter thr initial value:
3
Enter the value of n:
4
Sample Output:
The prime numbers are 3,5,7,11
4. the function getArraysum(int *arr, int len) is supposed to calculate and return the sum
of element of the input array arr of the length len (len>=0).
Sample input:
Enter the length of array:
5
Enter the value of array:
[25,10,5,3,7]
Sample output:
The sum of array is ‘50’
5. The function multiplyMinNumber(int *a, int len) accepts a array of length len as input.
It is supposed to return the multiplicative product of the minimum two values of input numbers without sorting.
Sample input:
Enter the length of array: 5
Enter thr value of array:
[5,9,11,7,10]
Sample output:
The product of maximum two input integer is “35”

Question: Find Missing Number in Series
A series of N numbers is given as the input. The program must print the missing number in the
given series.
Boundary Condition(s):
3 <= N <= 100
Input Format:
The first line contains N.
The second line contains N numbers separated by space(s).
Output Format:
The first line contains the missing number in the series.
Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
4
2 4 6 10
Output:
8
Example Input/Output 2:
Input:
3
5 15 20
Output:
10
